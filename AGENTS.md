This structure reflects the configuration described in the Godex system instructions, with directories for API endpoints, components, computer use (execution environments), the autonomous engine, environment definitions, framework configuration, QA gates, streaming logic, tool registry and general utilities.
API Endpoints
The following endpoints are used within the Godex ecosystem:
Endpoint	Method	Purpose	Notes
/api/godex/stream	GET (Server‑Sent Events)	Streams real‑time execution progress and results from the GodexStreamingEngine to the client. Uses the standard browser EventSource API.	
https://webcontainers.io/api/execute	POST	External API used by the GodexComputerUse module to execute JavaScript/Node code in a WebContainers.io environment.	
Google Generative AI API	varies (abstracted)	Used via the @google/genai SDK to access models such as gemini-2.5-pro. The specific endpoints are abstracted by the SDK.	
E2B Sandbox API	varies (abstracted)	Accessed via the @e2b/code-interpreter library to run code inside sandbox templates (e.g., Python code interpreter, Next.js developer environment). Endpoints are managed internally by the library.	
Tools Used
AI/LLM Integration
Tool/Library	Role
@google/genai	Provides access to Google’s Generative AI models; used by GodexAutonomousEngine to generate content.
@webcontainer/api	Bootstraps in‑browser Node.js environments (WebContainers) and offers file system and code execution capabilities.
@e2b/code-interpreter	Offers sandboxed execution of code with multiple templates (code interpreter, Next.js, Vue, Streamlit, etc.).
Core Application & Utilities
Tool/Library	Role
process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY	Environment variable storing the API key for accessing the Gemini model.
EventSource API	Browser API that receives server‑sent events from the /api/godex/stream endpoint.
fetch API	Standard web API used to send HTTP requests, such as posting code to WebContainers.
Conceptual Tools (defined in src/tools/registry.js)
Tool	Description
codeExecution	Executes code in supported runtime environments (WebContainers, E2B sandbox or local).
urlContext	Fetches and analyzes web content for context, such as documentation or API references.
fileManagement	Manages project files and structure (create, read, update, delete).
dependencyManagement	Handles package dependencies and resolves conflicts across ecosystems (npm, pip, composer, cargo).
Mobile Responsiveness Strategy
To ensure that the Godex UI is usable on mobile devices, the following strategies are recommended:
Use Tailwind CSS Responsive Variants. Tailwind CSS supports a mobile‑first approach where unprefixed classes apply to all screen sizes, and prefixed classes apply at specific breakpoints. The documentation explains that adding a viewport meta tag is essential and that you can prefix utilities with breakpoint names (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) to control behaviour at different widths
tailwindcss.com
. For example, w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48 sets progressively larger widths on larger screens
tailwindcss.com
. This approach allows the UI to adapt gracefully from small mobile screens to desktop layouts.
Implement a Mobile‑First Layout. Tailwind recommends targeting mobile screens by default and then overriding styles at larger breakpoints
tailwindcss.com
. Start by designing layouts for small screens (using unprefixed utilities) and layer on additional styling for sm, md, lg breakpoints as needed. This ensures the core experience works well on mobile devices.
Use Shadcn UI Components and Blocks. Shadcn UI provides collections of pre‑built components and blocks (combinations of components) that are fully responsive and tailored for desktop, tablet and mobile sizes
blog.logrocket.com
. Blocks can be copied into the project and will automatically adjust to various screen sizes, reducing the amount of responsive design work required.
Relative Units and Utility Classes. Adopt relative units (rem, em) for typography and spacing, and use Tailwind’s utility classes (e.g., flex, grid, p-4) to build flexible layouts. Combine these utilities with responsive prefixes to control padding, margin, and layout across breakpoints.
Optimize User Interactions. Ensure buttons and inputs have adequate tap targets and responsive spacing on touch devices. Use flex and grid utilities to align components properly and maintain accessibility.
Include the Viewport Meta Tag. As recommended in the Tailwind docs, add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> to the public/index.html file to ensure correct scaling on mobile devices
tailwindcss.com
.
By following these practices—particularly Tailwind’s responsive design techniques and Shadcn UI’s ready‑to‑use responsive blocks—the Godex interface can provide a smooth experience on mobile devices while retaining a cohesive look on larger screens.
Summary
The Godex Autonomous Coding Agent integrates Google’s Generative AI via the @google/genai SDK and executes code in WebContainers and E2B sandboxes. Its file structure separates API endpoints, UI components, the autonomous engine, environment definitions, quality gates, streaming logic and tool registration. A dedicated SSE endpoint (/api/godex/stream) feeds real‑time status updates to the client, while external endpoints handle code execution in WebContainers and sandbox environments. With tools for code execution, context retrieval, file management and dependency management, Godex can autonomously plan, implement and validate coding tasks. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI provide the foundation for a responsive, mobile‑friendly interface—using breakpoint‑prefixed utility classes and responsive blocks to adapt layouts across different screen sizes

AI Elements Component Library
AI Elements is a Vercel‑maintained component library built on top of shadcn/ui and designed specifically for AI‑native applications. The library provides pre‑built, customizable React components that streamline the creation of conversation interfaces, reasoning displays and other AI‑centric UI elements
raw.githubusercontent.com
. It is distributed as an npm package with a CLI that installs components into a project’s existing shadcn/ui directory and integrates required dependencies automatically
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
Installation and Prerequisites
AI Elements targets Next.js applications that already use the AI SDK and shadcn/ui. Projects should run on Node.js 18 or later, have shadcn/ui initialized, and use Tailwind CSS in CSS‑variable mode
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Installation can be done through the CLI:
Install all components:
npx ai-elements@latest
This command sets up shadcn/ui if needed, installs all AI Elements components to the configured components directory and adds required dependencies
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
Install specific components:
npx ai-elements@latest add <component-name>
The CLI supports installing individual components such as message, conversation or code-block
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Components can also be added via the shadcn CLI using registry URLs (https://registry.ai-sdk.dev)
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
Available Components
AI Elements includes a variety of components tailored to AI interfaces. Examples include conversation containers, message bubbles with avatars, inline citations, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and visualizations of AI reasoning or tool usage
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Each component comes with sensible defaults and can be customized via props and Tailwind utility classes.
Usage Example
After installation, components are imported from the configured directory (commonly @/components/ai-elements/). A simple chat interface can be assembled by combining the Conversation, ConversationContent, Message, MessageContent and Response components, together with the AI SDK UI useChat hook:
'use client';
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import {
  Conversation,
  ConversationContent,
} from '@/components/ai-elements/conversation';
import {
  Message,
  MessageContent,
} from '@/components/ai-elements/message';
import { Response } from '@/components/ai-elements/response';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat();
  return (
    <Conversation>
      <ConversationContent>
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <Message key={index} from={message.role}>
            <MessageContent>
              <Response>{message.content}</Response>
            </MessageContent>
          </Message>
        ))}
      </ConversationContent>
    </Conversation>
  );
}
This example leverages AI Elements components to render chat messages and responses, while the useChat hook from the AI SDK UI manages state and streaming
raw.githubusercontent.com
. The CLI ensures components are installed in the appropriate directory and integrated with existing shadcn/ui configuration
raw.githubusercontent.com
.
Recommended Configuration
For best results, the AI Elements documentation recommends enabling Vercel’s AI Gateway for API proxying, using the CSS Variables mode of shadcn/ui for theming, and working in a TypeScript environment
raw.githubusercontent.com
. These settings improve performance and developer experience when building AI interfaces.
Summary
The Godex Autonomous Coding Agent integrates Google’s Generative AI via the @google/genai SDK and executes code in WebContainers and E2B sandboxes. Its file structure separates API endpoints, UI components, the autonomous engine, environment definitions, quality gates, streaming logic and tool registration. A dedicated SSE endpoint (/api/godex/stream) feeds real‑time status updates to the client, while external endpoints handle code execution in WebContainers and sandbox environments. With tools for code execution, context retrieval, file management and dependency management, Godex can autonomously plan, implement and validate coding tasks. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI provide the foundation for a responsive, mobile‑friendly interface—using breakpoint‑prefixed utility classes and responsive blocks to adapt layouts across different screen sizes
tailwindcss.com
blog.logrocket.com
.
The newly integrated AI Elements library extends this ecosystem by offering ready‑made UI components—such as conversations, messages, code blocks and reasoning displays—specifically tailored for AI applications
raw.githubusercontent.com
. Installed via a CLI, these components drop into a shadcn/ui project and can be customized with Tailwind classes. They complement the AI SDK UI hooks (e.g., useChat) to deliver rich, interactive experiences. Using AI Elements in tandem with Godex and the AI SDK accelerates development of AI‑native user interfaces while preserving a responsive, mobile‑friendly design.

Configure Auth0
Get Your Application Keys
When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the Application Settings section in the Auth0 dashboard.
Basic Information








The Client Secret is not base64 encoded.App Dashboard

When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the Token Endpoint Authentication Method to None and set the Application Type to either SPA or Native.
You need the following information:

Domain
Client ID
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
Configure Callback URLs
A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the Allowed Callback URLs field in your Application Settings. If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the Allowed Callback URL to http://localhost:3000.
Configure Logout URLs
A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the returnTo query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the Allowed Logout URLs field in your Application Settings. If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout URL you need to add to the Allowed Logout URLs field is http://localhost:3000.
Configure Allowed Web Origins
You need to add the URL for your app to the Allowed Web Origins field in your Application Settings. If you don't register your application URL here, the application will be unable to silently refresh the authentication tokens and your users will be logged out the next time they visit the application, or refresh the page.

If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the Allowed Web Origins to http://localhost:3000.
Install the Auth0 React SDK
Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 React SDK:

npm install @auth0/auth0-react
Was this helpful?

/
The SDK exposes methods and variables that help you integrate Auth0 with your React application idiomatically using React Hooks or Higher-Order Components.

Configure the Auth0Provider component
Under the hood, the Auth0 React SDK uses React Context to manage the authentication state of your users. One way to integrate Auth0 with your React app is to wrap your root component with an Auth0Provider that you can import from the SDK.

import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
<Auth0Provider
    domain="vibecoding.us.auth0.com"
    clientId="NZ6vmEBXudwji6O3Tli0VkyKK8YVswsX"
    authorizationParams={{
      redirect_uri: window.location.origin
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
);
Was this helpful?

/
The Auth0Provider component takes the following props:

domain and clientId: The values of these properties correspond to the "Domain" and "Client ID" values present under the "Settings" of the single-page application that you registered with Auth0.
If you are using a custom domain with Auth0, the value of the domain property is the value of your custom domain instead of the value reflected in the "Settings" tab.
authorizationParams.redirect_uri: The URL to where you'd like to redirect your users after they authenticate with Auth0.
Auth0Provider stores the authentication state of your users and the state of the SDK — whether Auth0 is ready to use or not. It also exposes helper methods to log in and log out your users, which you can access using the useAuth0() hook.

Checkpoint
Now that you have configured Auth0Provider, run your application to verify that the SDK is initializing correctly, and your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
Add Login to Your Application
The Auth0 React SDK gives you tools to quickly implement user authentication in your React application, such as creating a login button using the loginWithRedirect() method from the useAuth0() hook. Executing loginWithRedirect() redirects your users to the Auth0 Universal Login Page, where Auth0 can authenticate them. Upon successful authentication, Auth0 will redirect your users back to your application.

import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

  return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>;
};

export default LoginButton;
Was this helpful?

/
This guide focuses on using the useAuth0() custom React Hook. If you are using class components, check out these samples using the
withAuth0()
higher-order component.
Checkpoint
Add the LoginButton component to your application. When you click it, verify that your React application redirects you to the Auth0 Universal Login page and that you can now log in or sign up using a username and password or a social provider.

Once that's complete, verify that Auth0 redirects you to your application using the value of the authorizationParams.redirect_uri that you used to configure the Auth0Provider.
Auth0 Universal Login

Auth0 enables the Google social provider by default on new tenants and offers you developer keys to test logging in with social identity providers. However, these developer keys have some limitations that may cause your application to behave differently. For more details on what this behavior may look like and how to fix it, consult the Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys document.
Add Logout to Your Application
Now that you can log in to your React application, you need a way to log out. You can create a logout button using the logout() method from the useAuth0() hook. Executing logout() redirects your users to your Auth0 logout endpoint (https://YOUR_DOMAIN/v2/logout) and then immediately redirects them to your application.

import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { logout } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: window.location.origin } })}>
      Log Out
    </button>
  );
};

export default LogoutButton;
Was this helpful?

/
Checkpoint
Add the LogoutButton component to your application. When you click it, verify that your React application redirects you the address you specified as one of the "Allowed Logout URLs" in the "Settings" and that you are no longer logged in to your application.
Show User Profile Information
The Auth0 React SDK helps you retrieve the profile information associated with logged-in users quickly in whatever component you need, such as their name or profile picture, to personalize the user interface. The profile information is available through the user property exposed by the useAuth0() hook. Take this Profile component as an example of how to use it:

import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth0();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading ...</div>;
  }

  return (
    isAuthenticated && (
      <div>
        <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
      </div>
    )
  );
};

export default Profile;
Was this helpful?

/
The user property contains sensitive information and artifacts related to the user's identity. As such, its availability depends on the user's authentication status. To prevent any render errors, use the isAuthenticated property from useAuth0() to check if Auth0 has authenticated the user before React renders any component that consumes the user property. Ensure that the SDK has completed loading before accessing the isAuthenticated property, by checking that isLoading is false.

Checkpoint
Verify that you can display the user.name or any other
user
property within a component correctly after you have logged in.

It looks like you’re working through Auth0’s setup steps to add authentication to a React application. These steps involve both the configuration in the Auth0 dashboard and the integration code in your React project. Below is a concise checklist of what you need to do and example code snippets based on the instructions you provided:
1. Configure your Auth0 Application
Identify your Auth0 Application: In the Auth0 dashboard, find the application you created (or that was created for you).
Retrieve keys: Under Settings, note the Domain and Client ID values (for example, vibecoding.us.auth0.com and NZ6vmEBX… in your example).
Set allowed URLs:
Callback URL: Add http://localhost:3000 to Allowed Callback URLs. This is where Auth0 will redirect users after login.
Logout URL: Add http://localhost:3000 to Allowed Logout URLs. This is where users will be redirected after logging out.
Allowed Web Origins: Add http://localhost:3000 to Allowed Web Origins. This allows silent token renewal.
If you’re using the built‑in “Default App” in Auth0, also set Application Type to SPA and Token Endpoint Authentication Method to None.
2. Install the Auth0 React SDK
From your project directory, run:
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
This package gives you the Auth0Provider component and hooks like useAuth0().
3. Wrap your app in Auth0Provider
In your main entry file (e.g., index.js), import Auth0Provider and wrap your root component:
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="vibecoding.us.auth0.com"
    clientId="NZ6vmEBXudwji6O3Tli0VkyKK8YVswsX"
    authorizationParams={{
      redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>
);
Replace domain and clientId with your own values from Auth0 if they differ.
4. Add a login button
Create a component that calls loginWithRedirect() from the useAuth0() hook:
// LoginButton.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>
      Log In
    </button>
  );
};

export default LoginButton;
Render this component somewhere in your UI (e.g., in your App component). Clicking it should redirect users to the Auth0 Universal Login page.
5. Add a logout button
Use the logout() method from useAuth0() to log users out and return them to your app:
// LogoutButton.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { logout } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        logout({
          logoutParams: {
            returnTo: window.location.origin,
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Log Out
    </button>
  );
};

export default LogoutButton;
6. Display user profile information
The useAuth0() hook also provides user, isAuthenticated, and isLoading values that you can use to show profile data:
// Profile.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth0();

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    isAuthenticated && (
      <div>
        <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
      </div>
    )
  );
};

export default Profile;
This component should only render a user’s profile when they are authenticated. Guarding your components with isAuthenticated and isLoading helps avoid errors during asynchronous loading.
Once you’ve added these components, start your development server and test the flow:
Click the Log In button → you should be redirected to Auth0’s Universal Login page.
Authenticate using a username/password or social provider.
Upon successful login, you should be redirected back to http://localhost:3000 and see the user profile.
Click Log Out → you should be logged out and redirected to your home page.
Feel free to customize the callback/logout URLs and domain/client ID to match your actual Auth0 tenant and hosting environment. If you need help adding this to a specific project structure or have other constraints, let me know!

This structure reflects the configuration described in the Godex system instructions, with directories for API endpoints, components, computer use (execution environments), the autonomous engine, environment definitions, framework configuration, QA gates, streaming logic, tool registry and general utilities.
API Endpoints
The following endpoints are used within the Godex ecosystem:
Endpoint	Method	Purpose	Notes
/api/godex/stream	GET (Server‑Sent Events)	Streams real‑time execution progress and results from the GodexStreamingEngine to the client. Uses the standard browser EventSource API.	
https://webcontainers.io/api/execute	POST	External API used by the GodexComputerUse module to execute JavaScript/Node code in a WebContainers.io environment.	
Google Generative AI API	varies (abstracted)	Used via the @google/genai SDK to access models such as gemini-2.5-pro. The specific endpoints are abstracted by the SDK.	
E2B Sandbox API	varies (abstracted)	Accessed via the @e2b/code-interpreter library to run code inside sandbox templates (e.g., Python code interpreter, Next.js developer environment). Endpoints are managed internally by the library.	
Tools Used
AI/LLM Integration
Tool/Library	Role
@google/genai	Provides access to Google’s Generative AI models; used by GodexAutonomousEngine to generate content.
@webcontainer/api	Bootstraps in‑browser Node.js environments (WebContainers) and offers file system and code execution capabilities.
@e2b/code-interpreter	Offers sandboxed execution of code with multiple templates (code interpreter, Next.js, Vue, Streamlit, etc.).
Core Application & Utilities
Tool/Library	Role
process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY	Environment variable storing the API key for accessing the Gemini model.
EventSource API	Browser API that receives server‑sent events from the /api/godex/stream endpoint.
fetch API	Standard web API used to send HTTP requests, such as posting code to WebContainers.
Conceptual Tools (defined in src/tools/registry.js)
Tool	Description
codeExecution	Executes code in supported runtime environments (WebContainers, E2B sandbox or local).
urlContext	Fetches and analyzes web content for context, such as documentation or API references.
fileManagement	Manages project files and structure (create, read, update, delete).
dependencyManagement	Handles package dependencies and resolves conflicts across ecosystems (npm, pip, composer, cargo).
Mobile Responsiveness Strategy
To ensure that the Godex UI is usable on mobile devices, the following strategies are recommended:
Use Tailwind CSS Responsive Variants. Tailwind CSS supports a mobile‑first approach where unprefixed classes apply to all screen sizes, and prefixed classes apply at specific breakpoints. The documentation explains that adding a viewport meta tag is essential and that you can prefix utilities with breakpoint names (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) to control behaviour at different widths
tailwindcss.com
. For example, w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48 sets progressively larger widths on larger screens
tailwindcss.com
. This approach allows the UI to adapt gracefully from small mobile screens to desktop layouts.
Implement a Mobile‑First Layout. Tailwind recommends targeting mobile screens by default and then overriding styles at larger breakpoints
tailwindcss.com
. Start by designing layouts for small screens (using unprefixed utilities) and layer on additional styling for sm, md, lg breakpoints as needed. This ensures the core experience works well on mobile devices.
Use Shadcn UI Components and Blocks. Shadcn UI provides collections of pre‑built components and blocks (combinations of components) that are fully responsive and tailored for desktop, tablet and mobile sizes
blog.logrocket.com
. Blocks can be copied into the project and will automatically adjust to various screen sizes, reducing the amount of responsive design work required.
Relative Units and Utility Classes. Adopt relative units (rem, em) for typography and spacing, and use Tailwind’s utility classes (e.g., flex, grid, p-4) to build flexible layouts. Combine these utilities with responsive prefixes to control padding, margin, and layout across breakpoints.
Optimize User Interactions. Ensure buttons and inputs have adequate tap targets and responsive spacing on touch devices. Use flex and grid utilities to align components properly and maintain accessibility.
Include the Viewport Meta Tag. As recommended in the Tailwind docs, add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> to the public/index.html file to ensure correct scaling on mobile devices
tailwindcss.com
.
By following these practices—particularly Tailwind’s responsive design techniques and Shadcn UI’s ready‑to‑use responsive blocks—the Godex interface can provide a smooth experience on mobile devices while retaining a cohesive look on larger screens.
Summary
The Godex Autonomous Coding Agent integrates Google’s Generative AI via the @google/genai SDK and executes code in WebContainers and E2B sandboxes. Its file structure separates API endpoints, UI components, the autonomous engine, environment definitions, quality gates, streaming logic and tool registration. A dedicated SSE endpoint (/api/godex/stream) feeds real‑time status updates to the client, while external endpoints handle code execution in WebContainers and sandbox environments. With tools for code execution, context retrieval, file management and dependency management, Godex can autonomously plan, implement and validate coding tasks. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI provide the foundation for a responsive, mobile‑friendly interface—using breakpoint‑prefixed utility classes and responsive blocks to adapt layouts across different screen sizes looks like you’re working through Auth0’s setup steps to add authentication to a React application. These steps involve both the configuration in the Auth0 dashboard and the integration code in your React project. Below is a concise checklist of what you need to do and example code snippets based on the instructions you provided:

### 1. Configure your Auth0 Application

1. **Identify your Auth0 Application**: In the Auth0 dashboard, find the application you created (or that was created for you).
2. **Retrieve keys**: Under **Settings**, note the **Domain** and **Client ID** values (for example, `vibecoding.us.auth0.com` and `NZ6vmEBX…` in your example).
3. **Set allowed URLs**:

   * **Callback URL**: Add `http://localhost:3000` to *Allowed Callback URLs*. This is where Auth0 will redirect users after login.
   * **Logout URL**: Add `http://localhost:3000` to *Allowed Logout URLs*. This is where users will be redirected after logging out.
   * **Allowed Web Origins**: Add `http://localhost:3000` to *Allowed Web Origins*. This allows silent token renewal.

   If you’re using the built‑in “Default App” in Auth0, also set **Application Type** to **SPA** and **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to **None**.

### 2. Install the Auth0 React SDK

From your project directory, run:

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

This package gives you the `Auth0Provider` component and hooks like `useAuth0()`.

### 3. Wrap your app in `Auth0Provider`

In your main entry file (e.g., `index.js`), import `Auth0Provider` and wrap your root component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';
import App from './App';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="vibecoding.us.auth0.com"
    clientId="NZ6vmEBXudwji6O3Tli0VkyKK8YVswsX"
    authorizationParams={{
      redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>
);
```

Replace `domain` and `clientId` with your own values from Auth0 if they differ.

### 4. Add a login button

Create a component that calls `loginWithRedirect()` from the `useAuth0()` hook:

```jsx
// LoginButton.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>
      Log In
    </button>
  );
};

export default LoginButton;
```

Render this component somewhere in your UI (e.g., in your `App` component). Clicking it should redirect users to the Auth0 Universal Login page.

### 5. Add a logout button

Use the `logout()` method from `useAuth0()` to log users out and return them to your app:

```jsx
// LogoutButton.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { logout } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        logout({
          logoutParams: {
            returnTo: window.location.origin,
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Log Out
    </button>
  );
};

export default LogoutButton;
```

### 6. Display user profile information

The `useAuth0()` hook also provides `user`, `isAuthenticated`, and `isLoading` values that you can use to show profile data:

```jsx
// Profile.js
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth0();

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    isAuthenticated && (
      <div>
        <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
      </div>
    )
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

This component should only render a user’s profile when they are authenticated. Guarding your components with `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading` helps avoid errors during asynchronous loading.

---Here’s the completed report in a markdown file: {{file:file-YTi6t2RToKv1ris8udh11s}}.

The report outlines the modular folder structure for the Godex autonomous coding agent, identifies its API endpoints and tool integrations, and recommends strategies for mobile responsiveness using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. It includes tables summarizing endpoints and tools, citations from official documentation, and practical design guidelines for responsive layouts.

I've expanded the original report to include detailed information about Vercel’s **AI Elements** library. The report now outlines the modular file structure of the Godex agent, key API endpoints, tools and utilities, mobile responsiveness strategies, and a dedicated section on AI Elements—covering installation requirements, available components, usage examples, and configuration tips. Here’s the updated report: {{file:file-QCcJZVfA2fUtyJ1UPF8yau}}.

Let me know if you need further enhancements or a deeper dive into any section.

Once you’ve added these components, start your development server and test the flow:

1. Click the **Log In** button → you should be redirected to Auth0’s Universal Login page.
2. Authenticate using a username/password or social provider.
3. Upon successful login, you should be redirected back to `http://localhost:3000` and see the user profile.
4. Click **Log Out** → you should be logged out and redirected to your home page.

Feel free to customize the callback/logout URLs and domain/client ID to match your actual Auth0 tenant and hosting environment. If you need help adding this to a specific project structure or have other constraints, let me know!
