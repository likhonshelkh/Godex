# Phase 03a – Verification of Implement streaming orchestration (agent-console-v1)

## Verification Steps
1. Confirm all checklist boxes in `03-implement-streaming.md` are checked.
2. Run `npx vitest run src/services/__tests__/godexClient.spec.ts` and confirm all tests pass.
3. Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure the codebase compiles without issues.
4. Inspect for leftover TODO stubs:
   - `rg "NotYetImplemented" src/services src/hooks lib/server` should yield no matches.
5. Check for unhandled promise rejections: `rg "catch" src/services/godexClient.ts` must show error normalization per repo guidelines (no bare `any`).

## Outcome
- Emit `✅` if every verification succeeds.
- Otherwise, list each failing point prefixed by `❌` with a brief explanation.
